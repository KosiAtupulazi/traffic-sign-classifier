Annotations

The annotation.zip contains two types of annotation present for each sequence and clip. 
The first annotation type contains information of the entire Traffic light area and what state the TL is in. 

This annotation file is called frameAnnotationsBOX, and is generated from the second annotation file by enlarging all annotation larger than 4x4. 
The second one is annotation marking only the area of the traffic light which is lit and what state it is in. This second annotation file is called frameAnnotationsBULB.

The annotations are stored as 1 annotation per line with the addition of information such as class tag and file path to individual image files. 
With this structure the annotations are stored in a csv file, where the structure is exemplified in below listing:

## 🚀 How to Run This App with Docker Compose

### 🐋 Step 1: Install Docker Compose v2 (No `sudo` Required)

If you're on Linux and don't have Docker Compose installed or can't use `sudo`, you can install it manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that Docker Compose is available:

```bash
docker compose version
```

You should see something like:

```
Docker Compose version v2.27.0
```

### 📂 Step 3: Navigate to the Project Root

Make sure you're in the root of the project (where `requirements.txt` is):

```bash
cd ~/personal_projects/traffic-sign-classifier-1
```

---

### 🧱 Step 4: Build and Run the App

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

This will:

* Build both the **FastAPI** and **Streamlit** containers
* Start them in sync
* Set up internal networking so Streamlit can call FastAPI using `http://fastapi:8000`
